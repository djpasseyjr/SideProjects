	<p>Reuters Staff, January 9th, 2018. Reuters (Unbiased)</p>
	<p>A french actress criticises the #MeToo campaign for undoing the good done by the sexual revolution. 
	  Very interesting that a supporter of the sexual revolution would denounce the #MeToo campaign.

	  Analysis of the events above from a liberal perspective. Provides excellent information about the cultural backdrop in France and helps clarify what may have been Deneuve's reasoning.

Fascinating analysis of the Aziz Ansari story. Characterizing this woman's experience as bad sex, Weiss claims that the woman should have stood up for herself.  Well argued and well written. The author was the newest op-ed hire at the New York Times.

Interesting look at what the Aziz story says about our culture. An examination of the nuances of women's sex experiences in our culture. Are women pressured to accept that things are &quot;fine&quot;?

	  The author makes strong arguments for &quot;enthusiastic consent&quot;. (I had some doubts about the authenticity of the article.) Real or fake, it is still an interesting contribution to the conversation.

	  Well written thoughtful exploration of the millennial dating culture. How a young man may seem like he is not coercing a young woman to have sex with him, but he is, he's just being more subtle.
