<h3>Why Articles?</h3>

<p>
I love to read articles. Well, what I really love is to learn something new&mdash;something crazy. I used to catch myself over and over again saying &quot;I read this article a month ago about...&quot;, but not remember where I read it or how to find it.  Now all of the articles are online in homegrown HTML and CSS, for me to reference and for you to enjoy.
</p>

<h3>Send Me Your Articles</h3>

<p>
When was the last time you read something that changed you? Maybe you thought about it for two weeks and told all your best friends about it. Maybe you treated people differently after reading it. Maybe it convinced you of something. If it meets any of this criteria, send it to me. I'll post it and attribute it to you.<p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>
Send me an email at djpasseyjr@gmail.com that includes:
<ul>
<li>A link to the article</li>
<li>How you would like to be attributed. (By full name, by first name and state you are from, etc.) </li>
<li>Why the article matters. Explain in a few lines why the article was impactful.</li>
</ul>
