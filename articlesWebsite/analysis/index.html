                Analysis of The Shocking Truth About Jordan Peterson
    	    </a></h3>
    	    Wesley Yang, May 28, 2018. Tablet Magazine (Center-Left bias)
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>As I've followed Jordan Peterson over the past nine months, I've watched him slowly gain the attention of more prominent news sources. At first, only feminist blogs and tabloids wrote hit pieces about him. Then Vox and Vice joined in, then the New York Times All the while, Peterson also caught the attention of a few wise journalists and smart thinkers. The Atlantic was one of the first sources to write a thoughtful article about him, followed by conservative op-ed writers at the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. This Tablet Magazine article is an even higher level of thinking and analysis, suggesting that Jordan Peterson is catching the attention of some of our brightest minds. I'd like to comment on two of Wesley Yang's observations.</p>
    
            <p><strong>1. Moderate is the New Enemy</strong></p>
            
            <p>A quote in large orange font reads,</p>
            <p>"We are living through a time of pervasive rhetorical overkill and genuine fear. In times of extremism, moderation itself can come to seem the greater enemy to those ideologically possessed."</p>
            
            <p>The point here is that our political spectrum has turned into two disparate groups where there is no place for moderates . When you are a moderate, there is no place for you in either camp and you become the enemy. I have observed this myself, when, after expressing an center-left  view, I feel the need to express conservative opinions to reassure friends that I'm still on their side. I feel afraid that they won't trust my opinions unless I am conservative enough. At the same time, I have too many conservative opinions to be trusted by the liberals I know. Thus, I  find myself creating a niche of my own. Why do we all live in dogma boxes? Why can't we live in a spectrum instead of a dichotomy?</p>
            
            <p><strong>2. What Will Happen to the Peterson Ideas?</strong></p>
            
            <p>Wang writes, "Jordan Peterson may have already allowed himself to become too immured in the fractiousness of our time to be the figure whose intervention breaks the fever. He is a messenger whose immoderate personal conduct has worked at cross purposes to the essential moderation of his message."</p>
            
            <p>While I am not sure to which aspect of Peterson's personal conduct Wang refers, I agree with this on some level. I believe that Peterson's strangeness will be his downfall. While at its core, the Peterson message calls for moderation in social change, his persona is ill-suited for this message. His flirting with meme culture, though well intentioned, makes him less relatable to average, moderate americans. His erudition and often humorless approach to debate distance him from warmer, gentler audiences. It also may be that the subculture of youtubers, redditors, and meme-makers with which he affiliates have given him a distasteful tinge.  Because of the strange crowd associated with him, Peterson's fundamentally moderate views fail to gain support in the realm of workaday americans. </p>
