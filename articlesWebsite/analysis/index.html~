      <div class="content">
	<p>While a student at BYU, a poster designed by my wife for the Women in Math club went viral on twitter.
	  Both she and her club became the subject of misinformed attacks and ridicule from feminists online. The story was
	  picked up by prominent news sources and several of them published charged articles that seemed to intentionally
	  misrepresent what occured. Ironically, my wife is a feminist and is highly active in promoting women in STEM.
	  All of these attackers must have believed that they were doing good, when in fact, they were hurting one of their own.
	  When the truth came out, many people wrote to my wife, expressed their support and apologized for jumping to 
	  conclusions.</p> 
	 <p>This site was organized with the intent to promote open conversation about issues and guard against jumping
	    to conclusions. I try to find articles with well reasoned, thoughtful arguments. Additionally I try to provide 
	    some context about the author and their biases. As for myself, I have a conservative bias, but lean left on
	    immigration, free trade, women's rights and am an antiracist. In general, I believe that every group deserves to
	    be listened to and understood. I hope my site reflects this. </p>
	 <p>I can only read so many articles on my own, and want to develop the content of my webpage. If you come across an
	   article that leaves you mulling over it for days, bothers you deeply, or even changes your life, please send it to
	   me at djpasseyjr@gmail.com. I will credit you when I post it. </p>
