# SideProjects
This contains the files for my website as well as several projects I've done for fun.

### articlesWebsite

This directory contains all of the files behind [articles.djpassey.com]([https//:articles.djpassey.com). I wanted to practice with HTML and CSS so I wrote them all myself. You can read about why I made the webpage [here](https://articles.djpassey.com/).

### predictPref.ipynb

This notebook walks through data cleaning, analysis and finding the best machine learning models to predict where individuals will spend money.

### DataVisualization.ipynb

This notebook contains my practice plots as I learned how to visualize data with python. (It's from before I learned pandas...unfortunately)
